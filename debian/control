Description: Multi-Tenant Device Access
 Multi-Tenant Device Access (or MTDA for short) is a relatively
 small Python application and library acting as an interface
 to a test device. It provides mechanisms to remotely turn the
 device on or off (assuming an IP/USB power switch is available),
 plug USB devices in or out (also requiring special hardware) or
 simply access its console (in most cases serial).
